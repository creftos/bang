Project Resources
=================


Documentation
-------------
The documentation is hosted on *Read the Docs*:

    http://bang.readthedocs.org/


Source Code
-----------
The stable codeline lives in *GitHub*:

    https://github.com/fr33jc/bang

Experimental or otherwise unstable development is also hosted on
GitHub in a separate clone:

    https://github.com/fr33jc/bang-unstable

Large patches from contributors will be integrated into the unstable
repo first.  When these new features have been tested and cleaned up
appropriately, they will be rebased and promoted to the stable master
for release.


Continuous Integration
----------------------
Pushes to the stable master trigger automated unit testing on *Travis
CI*:

    https://travis-ci.org/fr33jc/bang
