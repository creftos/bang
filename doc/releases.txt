Release Summary
===============


0.15 - November 4, 2014
-----------------------
- Expose bang server attributes to playbooks.  E.g. in an ansible
  template, ``{{bang_server_attributes.instance_type}}`` might
  resolve to the value ``t1.micro``.

- AWS

    - Fix security group handler.  Thanks Sol Reynolds!

- RightScale

    - Support all input types.  E.g. ``key:``, ``cred:``, ``env:``,
      etc...

0.14.1 - October 24, 2014
-------------------------
- Fix console logging level configuration.

0.14 - October 24, 2014
-----------------------
- AWS

    - Add support for creating S3 buckets (Thanks to Sol Reynolds).
    - Add support for IAM roles and other provider-specific server
      attributes.

- RightScale

    - *BREAKING CHANGE*: Inputs are now nested one level deeper in a
      server config stanza.

      This was done as part of adding support for provider-specific
      server attributes.  Prior to this change, one would specify the
      server template inputs in a rightscale server config like this:

      .. code-block:: yaml

          servers:
            my_rs_server:
              # other server attributes omitted for brevity
              provider: rightscale
              inputs:
                DOMAIN: foo.net
                SOME_OTHER_INPUT: blah blah

      Provider-specific attributes needed to create/launch servers
      will now be nested one level deeper in an attribute named after
      the provider.  With this new structure, the corresponding
      configuration for the example above would look like this:

      .. code-block:: yaml

          servers:
            my_rs_server:
              # other server attributes omitted for brevity
              provider: rightscale
              rightscale:
                inputs:
                  DOMAIN: foo.net
                  SOME_OTHER_INPUT: blah blah

    - Propagate rs deployment and server name to ec2 tags.

- Issues addressed

    - Fix handling of localhost in inventory
    - #11: Return sorted host lists for ``bang --list``.

0.13 - October 17, 2014
-----------------------
- Ansible integration

    - Allow setting some ansible options via bang config or
      ~/.bangrc:

        - Verbosity (especially for ssh debugging)::

            ansible:
              verbosity: 4

        - Vault::

            ansible:
              # ask_vault_pass: true
              # vault_pass: "thisshouldfail"
              vault_pass: "bangbang"

    - Test against ansible 1.7.2

- Add ``--no-deploy`` arg to only use existing infrastructure.
- Switch to yaml.safe_load.
- Improve compatibility with Python 2.6, including adding 2.6 as a
  Travis CI target.

0.12 - August 19, 2014
----------------------
- Update to ansible >= 1.6.3.

    - Allow ansible vars plugins to work.

- Add RightScale provider.

    - Add server creation and launch support.
    - Expose underlying RightScale response for errors.
    - Implement ``create_stack()`` to create RightScale
      *deployments*.

- Reuse existing servers *if possible*.  Some scenarios allow a
  server instance to be found and usable as a deployment target (e.g.
  bang run failed but server instance launched successfully).
- Allow configuration of logging via ~/.bangrc.
- Add backwards support for python 2.6.
- Reorganize and add new examples.

0.11 - January 8, 2014
----------------------
- HP Cloud provider

    - *BREAKING CHANGE*:  Separate HP Cloud v12 and v13 providers.  Users
      of HP Cloud services must now distinguish between the 2 different
      API versions of their resources.
    - Add new LB nodes before removing old; fixes error caused by
      HPCS' rule that a LB must have at least one node.

- Allow load balancers to be region-specific.


Older Releases
--------------
0.10.1 - July 22, 2013
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Remove install-time dependency on OpenStack client libraries.
  Users who need OpenStack/HP Cloud support must now install those
  libraries independently.  :ref:`Details... <openstack-deps>`

0.9 - July 16, 2013
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Update dependencies.  Now using:

    - Ansible 1.2
    - logutils >= 3.2

- Fix #4:  Set value for "Name" tag on EC2 servers
- Fix EC2 server provisioning

0.8 - May 7, 2013
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- AWS provider

    - Create and manage EC2 security groups and their rules.

0.7.1 - April 16, 2013
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fix installation breakage caused by conflicting dependency
  statements between python-reddwarfclient and python-novaclient.
  The resolution was to remove the explicit dependency on
  ``prettytable``.

0.7 - April 12, 2013
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- *BREAKING CHANGE*:  In a stack config file, the top-level resource
  definition containers were lists.  From 0.7 onward, they must be
  defined as dictionaries.  This allows resource definitions to be
  deep-merged.  The ``just_run_a_playbook.yml`` example was updated
  to demonstrate the new config format.

  This change extends the reuse of common config stanzas that was
  previously only available for *general stack properties* and for
  *configuration scopes* to *resource definitions*.  Prior to this
  change, the main purpose for this deep-merge behaviour was to allow
  sysadmins to use a known working dev stack config file and specify
  a *subset config file* to override secrets (e.g. encryption keys)
  when deploying production stacks.  With the deep-merging of
  resource definitions, deployers can override any part of the config
  file and break up their stack configurations into multiple reusable
  *subset config files* as is most convenient for them.  For example,
  one could easily deploy stack clones in multiple public cloud
  regions using a single base stack config and a subset stack config
  for each target region overriding ``region_name`` in the server
  definitions.

0.6 - April 3, 2013
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- HP Cloud provider

    - Add LBaaS support.

- Add "127.0.0.1" to the inventory to enable local plays.

  in a traditional server room, unmanaged virtual servers).

- Allow setting ssh username+password as command-line arguments.

0.5 - March 11, 2013
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
