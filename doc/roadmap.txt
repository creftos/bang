Road Map
========


Some of the feature ideas below will be implemented in bang.  Some
may be better suited for a *bang-utils* project.  They're listed here
so they won't be forgotten along the way.


General Features
----------------
- Allow overriding path to .bangrc via environment variable.  This
  allows external utilities to manage multiple sets of
  deployer_credentials (e.g. a bangrc per client).
- Add extension/plugin mechanism.  At the moment, the mercurial-style
  (i.e. using an rc-file for registering extensions) is the most
  palatable because it does *not* demand using setuptools, and
  because it allows the user to manage files how they please.

    - The corollary is that the setuptools-style (i.e. entry points
      defined in setup.py) mechanism is *not* desirable.

- In addition to the plugin mechanism, have some hookable events to
  make integration easier with existing tools that can't easily be
  converted to plugins.  E.g.::

    exec_hooks:
      pre_deploy:
      post_success:
      - /bin/echo yay
      post_failure:
      - /bin/echo boo

- Implement ``--dry-run``.
- Validate stack configuration.

    - Check for any build artifacts in the deployment S3 bucket/other
      central storage location.

- Allow absolute paths to playbooks, or a customizable playbook
  search path.

- Add playbook parallelization.  Allow running multiple playbooks at
  once.  Leave it up to the deployers to sort out inter-playbook
  dependencies.

- Integrate with revision control system.

    - Autoincrement *stack version* in config file.
    - Tag any config scope that defines a ``source_code`` attribute.
    - Generate release notes between tags.

- Autoscale servers.

- Add ``--destroy`` to automate destruction of stacks.

- Support ``ansible-playbook`` runtime options (e.g. vault and tag
  values).


Providers
---------
- AWS

    - Add any deployers that don't really apply to less featureful
      public cloud providers.  E.g. SQS, ELB, SNS, etc...
    - Create ssh keypairs if specified by the user in their
      ~/.bangrc.
    - Add DNS updates via Route53 API.

- Docker/LXC

    - Add Docker and LXC images as base images.
    - Add Docker and LXC containers to Ansible inventories.
    - Use Ansible playbooks to make changes within containers.

- Rackspace
- HP Cloud

    - DB Security Groups

- RightScale

    - Add this as a new provider and enable mixed RightScale+AWS
      stacks.
